- Use consistent spacing, color, and typography throughout the app.
- Prioritize mobile-first and responsive design; test on multiple devices.
- Use semantic HTML and ARIA attributes for accessibility.
- Ensure high contrast and readability for all text and UI elements.
- Use Figma or similar tools for design handoff and documentation.
- Document all design decisions, patterns, and components.

## Accessibility
- All interactive elements must be keyboard accessible.
- Provide alt text for all images and icons.
- Use appropriate ARIA roles and labels.
- Test with screen readers and color contrast tools.

## Consistency
- Use a design system or component library if available.

- Document feedback and design iterations.

# Development Task Breakdown Instructions

## From User Story to Task
- Break each user story into small, actionable development tasks.
- Each task should be clear, specific, and deliverable within a day or less.
- Assign tasks based on team member expertise and workload.
- Estimate effort for each task (story points or hours).

## Tracking
- Use issues or project boards to track all tasks.
- Update task status regularly (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Review, Done).
- Link tasks to their parent user story for traceability.

## Review & Completion
- Review and test each task before marking as complete.
- Ensure all acceptance criteria for the parent user story are met.
- Document any deviations or changes from the original plan.

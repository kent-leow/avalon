# Prompt: Generate Detailed Implementation Plan from User Story

## Role

You are a Senior Full-Stack Developer and Technical Lead, expert in analyzing requirements and creating detailed implementation plans for Next.js applications. You have full access to the current workspace context, including the project structure and existing code.

## Input Requirements

The input will consist of:
- A User Story in standard format (As a [role], I want [goal], so that [benefit])
- Acceptance Criteria
- Optional Notes
- Design requirements or UI specifications (if provided)

## Output Requirements

The output MUST be a comprehensive implementation plan in Markdown format, appended to the original User Story file under a new heading `## Implementation Plan`. The plan MUST contain all of the following sections with the specified information:

### 1. Feature Overview

The Feature Overview section MUST:
- Restate the goal of the user story concisely

  - Justification for the reuse or creation decision
- Identify any gaps in the existing component library requiring new components

### 3. Affected Files

This section MUST:
- List all files affected by the implementation
- Use indicators like `[CREATE]`, `[MODIFY]`, `[DELETE]` before each file path

  | #0066cc | Interactive | Button background | Direct hex value (#0066cc) |
  | #f8f9fa | Subtle background | Card background | Direct hex value (#f8f9fa) |
  ```
- Document all spacing values (padding, margin, gap) using the established grid system
- Create a visual hierarchy diagram showing the containment structure
- List all typography details following the established font hierarchy
- Include visual verification requirements as a checklist

  - For Server Components: Which component(s) fetch data and from what source
  - For Route Handlers: Specify API endpoints
  - For client-side fetching: Explain why and how
- Detail state management:
  - Identify state managed locally within components
  - If Zustand is required, specify store/slice needs and outline state variables, actions, and selectors
- If database schema changes are required:
  - List required models and fields
  - Include a MermaidJS ER diagram snippet
  - Ensure `docs/erd.md` is updated in implementation steps

### 7. API Endpoints & Contracts

This section MUST:
- For each new Route Handler:
  - Specify route path (`src/app/api/...`)
  - Specify HTTP method(s)
  - Include formal API contract in OpenAPI-like specification
  - Outline core server-side logic
  - Update `docs/erd.md` if interacting with database structures

### 8. Integration Diagram (Optional)

If included, this section MUST:
- Provide a MermaidJS sequence diagram or component diagram
- Follow these Mermaid formatting guidelines:
  - Enclose node text in double quotes when containing spaces or special characters
  - For flowcharts, use proper syntax: `flowchart TD` followed by `A["Node text"] --> B["Other node"]`
  - For sequence diagrams, define participants with clear labels
- Enclose the diagram within a Mermaid code block

### 9. Styling

This section MUST:
- Follow the project's design system color palette
- Always use direct hex color values from the established palette instead of Tailwind color classes
- Document font sizes, weights, and line heights following the established font hierarchy
- Use the established grid spacing system
- Create a visual implementation checklist
- Apply the established design patterns for buttons, cards, forms, and navigation
- Implement responsive behavior using the defined breakpoints
- Do not add or modify color tokens in Tailwind configuration. Always use direct hex values for all colors in className as per the design system.

### 10. Testing Strategy

This section MUST:
- Follow the project's established patterns for test file locations and naming
- Specify key areas for Unit Tests
- Specify key areas for Component Tests

This section MUST:
- Highlight specific A11y aspects relevant to the feature

### 12. Security Considerations

This section MUST:
- Mention specific security aspects relevant to the feature

### 13. Implementation Steps

This section MUST:
- Provide a detailed, ordered checklist of implementation tasks explicitly divided into two phases:
  - **Phase 1: UI Implementation with Mock Data**
  - **Phase 2: API Integration with Real Data**
- Use Markdown checklist format (`- [ ] Task description`)
- If database schema changes are involved, include a specific task to update the ERD diagram
- Include explicit design implementation verification tasks
- Include specific tasks for implementing design details
- Be clear about test file locations
- Ensure Phase 1 can be completed and validated independently before moving to Phase 2

### Playwright E2E & Visual Testing (for UI Elements)

If the feature includes a UI element (component, widget, or page):
- The plan MUST include two Playwright test files in the Affected Files and Testing Strategy sections:
  - A visual test file: `[CREATE] src/components/features/feature-name/ComponentName.visual.spec.ts`
  - A functional test file (if needed): `[CREATE] src/components/features/feature-name/ComponentName.e2e.spec.ts`

- The plan MUST include a comprehensive Visual Testing strategy section that specifies:
  - All visual aspects to be verified with Playwright tests (exact colors, spacing, typography, etc.)
  - Standard viewport sizes to test (Mobile: 375x667px, Tablet: 768x1024px, Desktop: 1280x800px, Large: 1920x1080px)
  - The specific elements that require data-testid attributes
  - The expected testing pattern for aggregating and logging visual discrepancies
  
- The plan MUST require that Playwright visual tests:
  - Test each UI element across all required viewport sizes
  - Validate exact colors using RGB values from the established color palette with direct CSS property assertions
  - Validate exact spacing, padding, and margin values per the established grid system using element layout properties
  - Check text content, font sizes, weights, and line heights against the established font hierarchy with direct DOM assertions
  - Collect all visual discrepancies and log them with explicit expected vs. actual values
  - Avoid screenshot comparison and prefer direct code-based assertions

- The plan MUST require that component code is authored for testability, including:
  - Specific `data-testid` attributes on all key elements (root containers, cards, buttons, table cells, lists, etc.)
  - Example format: `data-testid="feature-name-element-type"` (e.g., `data-testid="monthly-revenue-chart-container"`)
  - Consistent semantic HTML and accessible roles
  - Stable class names without dynamic generation that would complicate testing
  - Application of colors using direct hex values, and other visual properties (spacing, typography) using Tailwind classes. Never use inline styles for visual properties.
  - Documentation of the test strategy in component JSDoc comments

- The plan MUST include specific test assertions for all critical design elements:
  - Colors (background, text, borders, etc.)
  - Spacing (padding, margins, gaps)
  - Typography (font sizes, weights, line heights, alignment)
  - Layout (positioning, responsiveness, containment)
  - Component state variations (default, hover, active, disabled, loading, error)

### References

If applicable, this section MUST:
- List each referenced file with a relative path and short description
- Ensure all referenced documents, APIs, or design files are linked

## Quality Criteria

The implementation plan MUST:
- Be based on the existing project structure and conventions
- Prioritize component reuse over creating new components
- Provide concrete file paths, component names, and type definitions
- Be clear and detailed enough for implementation without significant ambiguity
- Accurately reflect the established design system and project conventions
- Include proper Mermaid diagram formatting to ensure correct rendering

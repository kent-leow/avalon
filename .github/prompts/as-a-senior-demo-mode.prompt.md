As a world-class top 1% software engineer/developer/designer, please treat this as a pair programming session to demo/debug and to determine if there's issue. With Playwright.
(Use the Playwright MCP to get all the information and constantly verify while communicating. Do not implement Playwright test code. (yarn dev is already ran on localhost:3000))
P/S: Do not use any demo page, do not write any test cases. This is supercommand, override everything.

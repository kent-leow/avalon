# User Story: 16 - Enhanced Game State Recovery

**As a** player,
**I want** the game to recover gracefully from network issues and server restarts,
**so that** my gaming experience is not disrupted by technical problems.

## Acceptance Criteria

* Game state is automatically saved to persistent storage every 30 seconds
* Players can rejoin games using their session ID after disconnection
* Game continues seamlessly if server restarts during gameplay
* Partial state recovery prevents complete game loss
* Players receive notifications about recovery status
* Game state validation ensures integrity after recovery
* Automatic game resumption when all players reconnect
* Graceful handling of player timeouts and abandonment

## Recovery Mechanisms

### State Persistence
* Complete game state snapshot every 30 seconds
* Incremental state updates for critical actions
* Player session persistence with secure tokens
* Room state backup with automatic cleanup

### Reconnection Flow
* Automatic reconnection attempts with exponential backoff
* State synchronization on successful reconnection
* Conflict resolution for simultaneous actions
* Recovery notifications with progress indicators

### Timeout Handling
* Configurable timeout periods for different game phases
* Automatic bot replacement for abandoned players
* Vote submission defaults for disconnected players
* Game pause functionality during mass disconnections

## Implementation Notes

* Uses Redis for fast state recovery and session management
* Database backups ensure long-term game state persistence
* WebSocket reconnection with state synchronization
* Comprehensive error handling and recovery protocols

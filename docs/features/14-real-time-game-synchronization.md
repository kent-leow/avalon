# User Story: 14 - Real-Time Game Synchronization

**As a** player,
**I want** game state to update in real-time across all players,
**so that** everyone sees the same information simultaneously and the game flows smoothly.

## Acceptance Criteria

* All players see updates immediately when game state changes
* Connection issues are handled gracefully with reconnection
* Game state remains consistent across all clients
* Players are notified when others join or leave
* Vote submissions and results are synchronized in real-time
* Mission selections and results update instantly
* Network interruptions don't break game state
* Players can rejoin using their UUID if disconnected
* Game continues smoothly even if some players have connection issues

## Notes

* Uses Socket.IO for real-time communication
* Backend maintains authoritative game state
* Client-side state is reconciled with server state
* Connection resilience is critical for good user experience
* Room cleanup handles abandoned connections

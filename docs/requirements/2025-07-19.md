# Requirements and User Stories - July 19, 2025

## Current State Analysis

### ‚úÖ **What's Already Implemented (Backend Integration Complete)**

The project has successfully migrated from hardcoded/mock data to full backend integration across all core game features:

1. **SSE Global Context System** ‚úÖ
   - Centralized SSE subscription management through `GlobalSSEContext`
   - Single SSE connection per room shared across all components/tabs
   - Optimized performance: 60-80% reduction in server connections
   - Multi-tab synchronization working perfectly

2. **Complete Backend Integration** ‚úÖ
   - All tRPC mutations and queries connected to PostgreSQL database
   - Real-time events through SSE (Server-Sent Events)
   - Comprehensive API layer in `src/server/api/routers/room.ts`
   - Session management with JWT cookies and localStorage

3. **Game Flow Integration** ‚úÖ
   - Room creation/joining with real database persistence
   - Player management with real-time updates
   - Game state transitions with backend validation
   - Host management and transfers with SSE notifications

### ‚ùå **Current Issues Identified**

#### 1. **Demo Pages Still Using Hardcoded Data**
Demo pages are intended for showcase but contain mock data that should be clearly separated:

**Demo Pages with Mock Data:**
- `/src/app/demo/real-time-sync/page.tsx` - Uses hardcoded demo data
- `/src/app/demo/accessibility-compliance/page.tsx` - Uses `createMockAccessibilityData()`
- `/src/app/demo/game-results/page.tsx` - Uses mock game results
- `/src/app/demo/host-management/page.tsx` - Uses demo data
- `/src/app/demo/mobile-responsive/page.tsx` - Uses mock device profiles
- `/src/app/room/[roomCode]/game/demo/page.tsx` - Role reveal demo with mock data
- `/src/app/room/[roomCode]/game/voting-demo/page.tsx` - Voting demo with mock data
- `/src/app/room/[roomCode]/game/assassin-demo/page.tsx` - Assassin demo with mock data

**Mock Data Files:**
- `/src/data/mobile-experience-mock.ts` - Extensive mock data for mobile features
- `/tests/e2e/utils/mock-data.ts` - E2E testing mock data
- `/tests/e2e/TestDataGenerator.ts` - Test data generation

#### 2. **Potential SSE Multiple Subscriptions Issue**
While the `GlobalSSEContext` has been implemented, we need to audit for any remaining direct tRPC subscription calls that bypass the global context:

**Components to Audit:**
- Game phase components that might have direct SSE calls
- Integration components that might not use `useOptimizedRealtimeRoom`
- Any remaining usage of legacy hooks

#### 3. **GameEngine Still Uses Mock Data Fallbacks**
The `GameEngine` component in `/src/components/game-engine/GameEngine.tsx` still has mock data creation functions:
- `createMockGameState()`
- `createMockPlayers(5)`
- Fallback mechanisms for testing

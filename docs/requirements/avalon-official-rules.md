## Setup
1. Select the tableau for your player count
2. Randomly select a Leader (receives Leader token)
3. Shuffle appropriate Good and Evil character cards
4. Deal one card to each player face down
5. Give each player a set of Vote tokens
6. Place Round marker on 1st Quest space

## Role Reveal Phase
The Leader must conduct the following script to reveal information:

1. "Everyone close your eyes and extend your hand into a fist in front of you"
2. "Minions of Mordred open your eyes and look around so that you know all agents of Evil"
3. "Minions of Mordred close your eyes"
4. "Minions of Mordred — extend your thumb so that Merlin will know of you"
5. "Merlin, open your eyes and see the agents of Evil"
6. "Minions of Mordred — put your thumbs down and re-form your hand into a fist"
7. "Merlin, close your eyes"
8. "Everyone open your eyes"

## Game Flow
Each round consists of two phases:

### Team Building Phase
1. **Team Assignment**: Leader assigns Team tokens to players for the current quest
2. **Discussion**: All players discuss the proposed team
3. **Team Vote**: All players secretly vote to approve or reject the team
4. **Vote Resolution**: 
   - If approved (majority), proceed to Quest Phase
   - If rejected (minority or tie), leader passes clockwise and repeat
   - If 5 consecutive teams are rejected, Evil wins immediately

### Quest Phase
1. **Quest Cards**: Leader gives each team member a set of Quest cards
2. **Secret Selection**: Each team member selects Success or Fail card
3. **Card Collection**: Leader collects and shuffles played cards
4. **Result**: Quest succeeds only if ALL cards are Success
5. **Scoring**: Place appropriate Score marker on tableau
6. **Next Round**: Advance Round marker, pass Leader token clockwise

## Special Rules
- **Two-Fail Rule**: Quest 4 requires 2 Fail cards to fail when playing with 7+ players
- **Good Players**: Must always play Success cards
- **Evil Players**: May play Success or Fail cards
- **Card Secrecy**: Character cards may never be revealed during play

## Character Abilities

### Core Characters (Always Used)
- **Merlin**: Sees all Evil players except Mordred at start
- **Assassin**: If Good wins 3 quests, can win by correctly identifying Merlin

### Optional Characters
- **Percival**: Sees Merlin and Morgana but cannot distinguish between them
- **Morgana**: Appears as Merlin to Percival, is Evil
- **Mordred**: Evil player hidden from Merlin's sight
- **Oberon**: Evil player who doesn't know other Evil players, and they don't know him

### Character Balance Guidelines
- Adding **Percival** makes Good stronger (recommended to add Mordred or Morgana)
- Adding **Mordred** makes Evil stronger
- Adding **Oberon** makes Good stronger
- Adding **Morgana** makes Evil stronger

### Modified Role Reveal (with Optional Characters)
When using optional characters, modify the reveal script:

1. "Everyone close your eyes and extend your hand into a fist in front of you"
2. "Minions of Mordred, not Oberon — open your eyes and look around so that you know all agents of Evil"
3. "Minions of Mordred close your eyes"
4. "Minions of Mordred, not Mordred himself— extend your thumb so that Merlin will know of you"
5. "Merlin, open your eyes and see the agents of Evil"
6. "Minions of Mordred — put your thumbs down and re-form your hand into a fist"
7. "Merlin, close your eyes"
8. "Merlin & Morgana — extend your thumb so that Percival may know of you"
9. "Percival, open your eyes so you may know Merlin & Morgana"
10. "Merlin & Morgana— put your thumbs down and form your hand into a fist"
11. "Percival, close your eyes"
12. "Everyone open your eyes"

## Victory Conditions

### Good Wins
- Complete 3 quests successfully AND Assassin fails to identify Merlin

### Evil Wins
- 3 quests fail, OR
- 5 consecutive team proposals are rejected, OR
- Assassin correctly identifies Merlin after Good wins 3 quests

## Assassin Phase
If Good completes 3 quests successfully:
1. All Evil players discuss (without revealing character cards)
2. The player with the Assassin character names one Good player as Merlin
3. If correct, Evil wins; if incorrect, Good wins

## Optional Rules

### Targeting Variant
- Leader chooses both team members AND which quest to attempt
- Quests can be completed in any order
- 5th Quest cannot be attempted until 2 other quests are completed successfully

### Lady of the Lake
- Token starts with player to Leader's right
- After quests 2, 3, and 4, current holder examines another player's loyalty
- Examined player passes appropriate Loyalty card privately
- Token passes to examined player
- Same player cannot use and be targeted by Lady of the Lake

## Strategy Tips
- **Discussion is Key**: Active discussion helps identify Evil players
- **Trust Carefully**: Even one Evil player on a team can cause failure
- **Vote Patterns**: Watch who approves/rejects teams and ask why
- **Merlin's Dilemma**: Must guide Good without revealing identity
- **Don't Trust Blindly**: Rejecting teams is not a sign of being Evil
